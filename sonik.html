            <h2> INTRO ABOUT SONIC</h2>

The title character of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog video game franchise, Sonic is an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog who can run at supersonic speeds and curl into a ball to attack enemies. He races through levels, collecting power-up rings and avoiding obstacles, as he seeks to defeat the mad scientist Doctor Eggman.  </p>

           <h1> Knuckles the Echidna</h1>
           <p>Knuckles the Echidna[h] is a red echidna and Sonic's friendly rival. First introduced in the Genesis game Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Knuckles lives on Angel Island, which hovers in the sky due to the power of the Master Emerald. As the last surviving member of the Echidna people who once inhabited the island, his duty is to guard the Master Emerald.

            During conception of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, the development team wanted to create a new rival for Sonic. The final design of Knuckles was the result of dozens of possible designs inspired by numerous different animals.[44] A character with many different abilities and skills, he is physically one of the strongest characters of the Sonic series.[45] His strength and mastery of martial arts, specialising in punches, enables him to perform feats such as shattering boulders with his fists, while he can trap air underneath his dreadlocks in order to glide for short distances.</p>

        <h1> Amy Rose</h1>
        <p>  Amy Rose[f] is a pink hedgehog and Sonic's self-proclaimed girlfriend,[17] who is an energetic tomboy.[18] Amy was created by Kazuyuki Hoshino for Sonic the Hedgehog CD (1993),[19] although she appeared Kenji Terada's Sonic the Hedgehog manga a year before.[20] Hoshino created her in-game graphics, with many staff members contributing ideas to her design. Her headband and trainer shoes reflected Sonic CD director Naoto Ohshima's tastes, and her mannerisms reflected the traits Hoshino looked for in women at the time.[19] Her fur color was red at first, and her skirt orange.[21] The character had two other names in game previews: Rosy the Rascal[22] and Princess Sally (a character in the Sonic the Hedgehog TV series and comics).[21][23] Amy received her present design, with a red dress and boots, in Sonic Adventure (1998),[24] courtesy of designer Yuji Uekawa.[25]</p>

        <h1> Tails </h1>
        <p>
            Miles Prower,[d] better known by his nickname, Tails,[e] is a two-tailed fox who is Sonic's best friend and sidekick. His name is a pun on "miles per hour". He can use his tails to propel himself into the air like a helicopter for a limited time. Yasushi Yamaguchi, originally the main artist and zone designer for Sega's Sonic Team, designed Tails for an internal competition for a sidekick to Sonic. His first appearance was in Sonic 2 for the Game Gear, where he was kidnapped by Doctor Robotnik for a "hefty" ransom. He was first made playable in the Genesis version of Sonic the Hedgehog 2.[11] Tails has appeared in almost every Sonic game since his first appearance. Tails starred in two solo spin-off games for the Sega Game Gear in 1995 â€“ Tails' Skypatrol, and Tails Adventure.[12] Frequently portrayed as a sweet-natured[13] and humble fox,[14] Tails used to be picked on because of his twin tails, before he met Sonic.[15] Tails has a very high IQ and excellent mechanical skills

        <h1> Sticks </h1>
        <p>Sticks the Badger[an] (voiced by Nika Futterman in English and Aoi Yuki in Japanese[255]) is an orange and brown badger, first introduced in the animated Sonic Boom television series. Her characteristics are wild, energetic and paranoid, having lived in the wilderness alone for most of her life. Nonetheless, she is portrayed as wanting to strengthen her newfound friendship with Sonic, Amy, Tails and Knuckles.[256]

            Sticks appears in a non-playable role in Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric and as a playable character in Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal.
            
            She is described as "infantile" by Scott Thompson of IGN[257] and an "unlikeable idiot" by Becky Cunningham of GamesRadar,[258] albeit a "nice addition" by Chris Carter of Destructoid.[259]
            
            Sticks has appeared in other Sonic Boom titles, including Sonic Dash 2: Sonic Boom and Sonic Boom: Fire & Ice, and has appeared in other Sonic titles not associated with the Boom sub-series, such as Sonic Runners and Mario & Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. She is mentioned in the mainline Sonic game Sonic Frontiers.[2</p>
